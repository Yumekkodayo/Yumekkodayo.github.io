## Superchain Theory 1

The debuffs applied during Superchain Theory 1 split the party into tanks/healers and DPS:

- One role is responsible for placing and resolving the aspected towers.
- The other role will spread for the Heavensflame AoEs.

Because of this, the movement after the third set of shapes is fixed:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tanks + Healers Heavensflame, DPS towers</th>
    <th>DPS Heavensflame, Tanks + Healers towers</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>

## Limit Cut

Limit Cut can be broken into two parts- the first four dashes, and the last four dashes.

Within each block of four dashes, the center add will do a small 270-degree cleave in the middle twice, and fire two beams at the two closest players twice, **all in a random order**.
