# Alphascape V4.0 (Savage) - Part 1

### Things to check on Party Finder

- **Light parties**: Are the teams are determined by position (93固定, short for 9時3時固定), or determined by M/F (男女固定)- **most groups do M/F**
- **Remote Resistance**: Will the bosses be brought together at a fixed location (usually at 3 o'clock, relative to the eye), or if the OT always moves to the MT.
- **Operational Synergy: Synthetic Blades**: Whether the stack point for Pile Pitch is back-left (左後), or back-right (右後)
- **M/F Limit Break**:
  - Where is Sagittarius Arrow pointing (towards the eye, or away from the eye).
  - Is the plan to tank LB3 the mechanic, or save LB3 for melee LB.
