# Abyssos: The Sixth Circle (Savage)

The following macros are from [Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/479307), which uses Nukemaru's strat:

{% include youtube.html id="pibChZ8AjZ8" %}

*Some* parties will replace Nukemaru's Cachexia 1 with ZizieZip's method (see below).

## Japanese

*(Nukemaru's Cachexia 1)*
```
{% include_relative macros/p6s_nukemaru.jp.txt %}
```

## English

*(Nukemaru's Cachexia 1)*
```
{% include_relative macros/p6s_nukemaru.en.txt %}
```

**English** parties will replace Nukemaru's Cachexia 1 strat with [ZizieZip's Cachexia 1 strat](https://twitter.com/ZizieZip/status/1564991162775060480).


## English

*(ZizieZip's Cachexia 1)*
```
{% include_relative macros/p6s_ziziezip.en.txt %}
```

## Japanese

*(ZizieZip's Cachexia 1)*
```
{% include_relative macros/p6s_ziziezip.jp.txt %}
```

## Markers (Nukemaru)

These markers are for Nukemaru's Cachexia 1:

- `1` and `A`: 8 seconds
- `2` and `B`: 12 seconds
- `3` and `C`: 16 seconds
- `4` and `D`: 20 seconds

Players rotate moving "down" in the markers (i.e: 4→3→2→1→4 and D→C→B→A→D)

## Markers (ZizieZip)

These markers are for ZizieZip. The markers are colour-coded in each corner to make callouts easier.

In addition, the "purple-ish" markers are on the west side, and the "green-ish" markers (blue + yellow) are on the east side to help remember which side the purple/green debuffs go.

Letters are N/S, while numbers are E/W to also help with that grouping when dodging the fan AoEs.

## Cachexia 1

English PFs will use ZizieZip's strat to resolve Cachexia 1.

Note that there are two versions of the strat going around:

1. One based on roles (this is the one used in the macro)
2. One based on timers (we aren't using this)

The two players with the 20s debuffs start a little under the boss. All other players can wait for their vulnerability debuff to wear off before then stepping inside the boss's hitbox.
