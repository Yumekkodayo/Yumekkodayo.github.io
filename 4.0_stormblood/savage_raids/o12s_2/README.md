## Patch

There are two main ways of doing this:
  - TTHH (Far tank → Near tank → H2 → H1)
  - HTHT (Near healer → Far tank → Far healer → Near tank)

Each tether is broken in between Patch mechanics in the chosen order above:
  - 1st: ASAP
  - 2nd: After Diffuse Wave Cannon
  - 3rd: After Oversampled Wave Cannon
  - 4th: After debuffs from 3rd break wear off

## Hello, World

The "big" mechanic for O12S-2 is "Hello, World". There were two main strategies, **1313** (also referred to as the "One-Ace", or "1A" strat) and **134**.

The digits refer to the number of Critical Overflows that were being resolved in each stage. While both strategies were used, 1313 eventually took over and became the default once Savage lockouts were removed.

Separate macros were made to describe everybody's movement for each strategy, but it's easier to just use a diagram instead.
