# Storm's Crown (Extreme)

This is [Game8's macro](https://game8.jp/ff14/477950).

It's basically [Hamkatsu's strat](https://youtu.be/FToWDK7uy4w), but resolves Playstation symbols in a "braindead" manner (T/H go to assigned cardinals, DPS all stack in the center and get pulled to their assigned partner).

## Markers

You might see the `ABCD` markers placed further out towards the edge of the arena.

- `ABCD`: Orientation, T/H Playstation positions
- `C`: Party stack during 2x Flares + stack
- `1` and `3`: Enumeration pairs during Teasing Tangles
