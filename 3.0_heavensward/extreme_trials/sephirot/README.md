# Containment Bay S1T7 (Extreme)

An up-to-date reference would be Nukemaru's guide:

## Markers

The `B` and `C` markers were used for Earthshakers as they are proximity damage in Sephirot EX.

**Earthshakers have been changed in the Unreal version of the fight, and are not proximity damage.**

* `A`: Party stack at the start of the triple-knockback sequence.
* `B`: DPS Earthshaker (not really needed for Unreal)
* `C`: Healer Earthshaker (not really needed for Unreal)
* `1`: Green players stack (with tethers).
* `2`: Orange players stack.
