# About Elemental

Elemental is a Japanese FFXIV data center; however, it is home to servers with high populations from South East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand such as Tonberry or Kujata.

Because Elemental is ultimately a Japanese DC, the macros here are for **Japanese** PF strategies. Once in a while, the English community splinters and adds their own modifications.

## On macros

Remember, the ultimate goal of PF macros is to get eight people who have never played together a clear (quickly). As a result, PF favours safer, simpler strategies, even if it means disconnecting from the boss.

**If you want uptime, make a static.**

**Tanks:**
- Who MTs (main-tanks) and who STs (sub-tanks) generally follows this order:
    
    **MT** : WAR > DRK > GNB > PLD : **ST**

- You will often see English players call the ST the OT instead (off-tank).
- A note on tank swaps: Sometimes, the "MT" position refers to the original maintank, and sometimes "whoever happens to be tanking the boss at the time". As a general rule, if where the boss faces is relevant, then "MT" will refer to whoever is currently tanking the boss.

**Healers:**
- **H1** is the "pure healer" (WHM, AST).
- **H2** is the "barrier healer" (SCH, SGE).

**DPS:**
The standard composition consists of one melee, one physical ranged, one caster, and one flex DPS (typically a second melee/caster).

- **D1** is the melee spot (SAM, DRG, MNK, RPR, NIN)
- **D2** is the flexible DPS slot, and is typically a second melee or caster.
- **D3** is a physical ranged (BRD, MCH, DNC)
- **D4** is a caster (BLM, RDM, SMN)

## PF and progression

Generally, PF recruitment will generally follow the following progression:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>First time</b></td>
    <td><b>初見</b></td>
    <td>Sometimes, you'll see 未予習 which means "without prep" or basically going blind, or 予習済 which is "have prepared" (have watched guides/videos)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Practice○○</b></td>
    <td><b>○○練習</b></td>
    <td>You will often see a mechanic in place of ○○, although 前半 is also common ("first half"). The focus is on learning the mechanic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Stabilize○○</b></td>
    <td><b>○○安定</b></td>
    <td><p>An extension of the above, except you are expected to have reached the mechanic before and the aim is to resolve the mechanic consistently.</p><p>You may also see "Skillup/練度上げ" parties- these are typically parties that have already cleared, but would essentially like to "stabilize" the clear. <b>These are not parse parties.</b></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Aim to clear (A2C)</b></td>
    <td><b>クリ目</b></td>
    <td><p>It is expected that you have made it to enrage at this point, and know all the mechanics. A couple words to look out for are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>未 (not yet)</b>;　e.g: "未消化" = "not yet done weeklies"</li>
      <li><b>済 (already)</b>;　e.g: "クリア済" = "already cleared"</li>
      <li><b>手伝いさん</b> (helpers)</li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Weekly clear</b></td>
    <td><b>消化</b></td>
    <td><p>You'll often see additional stipulations, like the party disbanding after three wipes, or after 30 minutes. These aren't practice parties. At least, they're not supposed to be. -_-</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>3滅解散</b>: "disband after three wipes" is quite common with these parties.</li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Parse</b></td>
    <td><b>(火力)詰め</b></td>
    <td>These are runs that aim to get a good parse for FFLogs. BiS (Best-in-slot gear is typically expected) and you are expected to be comfortable with the fight.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Loot rules

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>L>R</b></td>
    <td><b>取り抜け</b></td>
    <td><p>"Take loot and drop".</p>
    <p>This is typically seen in Savage weekly clears.</p>
    <p>Everyone takes turns rolling on loot one at a time. Anyone who wins an item then drops from the instance (so everyone only gets 1 item at most).</p><p>Oftentimes, this is "take and drop from the left" (左から取り抜け), but it's also common to explicitly list out an order for 4th floor raids, like "Weapon > Weapon coffer > Body coffer > Others" (武器＞武器箱＞胴箱＞他) </p>
    <p>While it is not enforcible that players don't just loot on multiple items, doing so would almost certainly get you blacklisted, and is a reportable offense.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>FFA</b></td>
    <td><b>フリロ</b></td>
    <td><p>"Free-lot" or "Free for All".</p><p>Everyone rolls Need/Greed on the items that drop.</p><p>This is more typically practiced when doing Savage weekly clears via the Raid Finder.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
