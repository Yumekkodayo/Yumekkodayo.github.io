# Eden's Promise: Umbra (Savage)

The standard PF strategy uses [Akito's strat (あきと式)](https://youtu.be/FMJ2W5_MLW8) as a base, but replaces the Empty Plane positions with Yamipika (やみぴか) positions, although you'll often see "天空近接内" instead (melees in for Empty Plane). Yamipika essentially ensures tanks and melee DPS have full uptime on the boss throughout the Empty Plane phase.

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Tower positions may be flipped horizontally.
- It's also worth checking the Empty Plane positions just to be sure.
