# The Minstrel's Ballad: The Endsinger's Aria

PF largely follows Nukemaru's guide:

{% include youtube.html id="dwZ8uVCPI80" %}

## Japanese

This is the [game8 macro](https://game8.jp/ff14/446913) that's being used:
```
{% include_relative macros/endsinger.jp.txt %}
```

## English
```
{% include_relative macros/endsinger.en.txt %}
```

## Markers

The intercardinal `1234` markers are the impact points for all the planetary collisions.

All markers are the player positions for Flare/AoEs during Theological Fatalism (player debuffs). The center `C` marker is for the Donuts + stack (people tend to stack too far south otherwise).

You also want to mark the two healers for stacks.

## Theological Fatalism (5-heads)

An easy way to resolve the 5-heads mechanic is:

1. From the third donut, determine whether your current quadrant will be cleaved by the center head:
	- If it **will** get cleaved, cross over diagonally to the opposite quadrant.
	- If it **won't** get cleaved, stay in your current quadrant.
2. Check the number of rings in your current quadrant:
	- If it is **odd**, stay in your current quadrant.
	- If it is **even**, move to the other quadrant that won't get cleaved by the center head.

## 2x Fatalism

If you have LB3 available during the 2x Fatalism (quadruple planets), a Tank LB3 right after the second planet collision will allow players to survive red planet hits during the harder "blue-to-red" planet sequence.

To get the LB3 by this time, you will need a standard party setup with no duplicate jobs.
