# Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage)

By the end of the tier, the most common strategies were "DD out", "Ayatori Light Rampant" and either the "Fixed at red" or "Arthars' strat" (a.k.a. "KB uptime) for Hallowed Wings.

## English

*(DD out, Ayatori Light Rampant, "Fixed at red Hallowed Wings)*
```
{% include_relative macros/e8s.en.txt %}
```

## Japanese

*(DD out, Ayatori Light Rampant, "Fixed at red Hallowed Wings)*
```
{% include_relative macros/e8s.jp.txt %}
```

## Diamond Frost/ダイモンド・ダスト(DD)

(Yes, it's called "Diamond Frost", not "Diamond Dust" in English...)
  - **DD in/内捨て**: Everyone gets knocked back to the edges.
  - **DD out/外捨て**: Only Flare'd healer gets knocked back. Everyone else uses Arm's Length/Surecast. DPS baiting AoEs start in the south sector.

*Driving/Biting Frost*:
  - **Japanese** parties will always face the boss outside the arena, and it is the party's responsibility to move to the safe side.
  - **English** parties will have the MT turn the boss so the safe side faces the party (i.e: if the boss did Biting Frost first)


## Light Rampant/光の暴走

The standard is **Ayatori's strat/あやとり式**:

## Hallowed Wings/ぼよんぼよん

(In particular, the Hallowed Wings to the front)
There are three main ways of doing this-
- **アーサー/"Arthars' strat"/"KB Uptime strat"**: Arm's Length/Surecast both knockbacks. Surecast timing is tight; screwing it up will get you tossed off the arena.

  - JP explanation: [video](https://youtu.be/hCiDNU6pIxk)  

- **赤固定:/"Fixed at red"**: Party moves towards the red mirror and uses Arm's Length/Surecast. Party will get knocked back on the third Wings. Safest, but less uptime compared to Arthas'.

- **色固定/"Fixed at colours"**: Party moves towards the green mirror. No Arm's Length/Surecast. Party will get knocked twice, on the second and third Wings. This strat is the least common.

## Final Akh Morns/最終のアク・モーン

D2 and D3 will need to swap Akh Morn stacks if both reds or both blues are on the same side. Oftentimes, this is done after the first (5-hit) Akh Morn, but it is sometimes done before.
