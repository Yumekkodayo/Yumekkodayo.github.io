# Eden's Promise: Anamorphosis (Savage)

- [Akito's strat (あきと式)](https://youtu.be/b7g-6n4VSoY)
- [Shinosho's strat (しのしょー式)](https://youtu.be/7oHPKKDYgto)

The two are effectively identical if doing the Hobolala strat for Sundered Sky. The only difference to check is the second Turn of the Heavens.

### Things to check on Party Finder

Where all the tethers/prey markers go. Most of the time, Fire goes behind, while Lightning and Holy are resolved in front. 

### Approximate milestones

- **45%** HP when the boss disappears for Sundered Sky.
- **24%** HP when the boss disappears for Prismatic Deception.

## Damage sources

As there are a number of attacks in this fight that do not have a clearly associated mechanic, the following may help groups figure out what went wrong:

**Ageless Serpent** - Knockback damage when the dragon lands (Shifting Sky, Sundered Sky)
**Burn Mark** - AoE damage when the Powder Mark debuff expires
**Blastburn** - Burnt Strike (Fire) : Knockback from the line's center
**Blasting Zone** - Prismatic Invisibility line AoEs
**Brightfire** - Red/blue circle AoE damage (Turn of the Heavens, Shifting Sky)
**Bright Pulse** - Panel "laser" beams (Right of the Heavens)
**Bow Shock** - Bound of Faith (Lightning) : Conal cleaves originating from the target
**Burnout** - Burnt Strike (Lightning) : Second (wider) line AoE
**Mortal Burn Mark** - Bound of Faith (Holy) : Raid-wide damage when the debuff expires
**Resonant Winds** - Donut AoE (on the light part of the floor) in Shifting Sky
**Resounding Crack** - Dragon 270-degree cleave in Sundered Sky
**Shining Blade** - Burnt Strike (Holy) : Baited Light AoE puddles
**Sinsight** - Elemental Break (Holy) : Tank/healer shared cleaves
**Sinsmite** - Elemental Break (Lightning) : AoE damage on each player
**Sinsmoke** - Elemental Break (Fire) + Bound of Faith (Fire) : Shared AoE damage 

## Sundered Sky "Hobo Lala" strat (堕獄絶技 ほぼララ式)

This is the de-facto way to resolve Sundered Sky in PF.

1. Knockback → run anti-clockwise around
2. Fire out, Light in

## 2nd Turn of the Heavens

The standard way to resolve the second Turn of the Heavens (the one with alternating blue/red circles) is to fix player positions
