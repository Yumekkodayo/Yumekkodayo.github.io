## Markers

All markers (except for a center marker) mark safe spots during Visceral Whirl.

In addition, the `AB` markers are for the party to stack at during Black Hole, while the `12` markers are for the marked player dropping the Black Hole.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Meteors]</b> Can you jump off the edge to remove a tether?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Alas, no- once the tethers come out, they persist through death.</p><p>You'll respawn at the start point, where the southern meteor is, still tethered, and wipe the raid.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Meteors]</b> Can a tank invuln the tethers and not stretch their tether instead?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Alas, no- the damage from the tethers ignores invulnerability.</p><p>With some help from the party, an unstretched tether <em>can</em> be super-mitigated- it will hit a tank for about 300% of their max HP (remember there are Max HP down debuffs at the time!).</p></td></tr>
