### Flamerake

With Nukemaru's strat, players that need to rotate always rotates clockwise. The final spread positions are not the true-north spread positions, but are in whatever orientation the party ends up in at the end of Flamerake.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Players stand in pairs at the cardinal positions.</p>
    <p><em>(In this example, tanks/healers have the Flare markers)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_1.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> If the spinner ends up pointing at you, rotate clockwise.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_2.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> The Flare players rotate clockwise into the first set of AoEs.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_3.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Flare players step in, while the stack players step out and spread according to your current positions (depending on how many times you had to rotate).</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_4.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
