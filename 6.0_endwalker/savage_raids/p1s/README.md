# Asphodelos: The First Circle (Savage)

PF references the following guides for P1S:

- [Inumaru](https://youtu.be/Hb7zp2AUACA)
- [Nukemaru](https://youtu.be/6Q2IMu5cINQ)

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check the chain pairs (Japanese groups pair MT+D4 instead of MT+D3, etc.)
- Check the markers. In particular, Japanese groups rotate all the outer markers clockwise.

## Markers

The markers are for the purple/red chains. `1234` are for the red chains, while `ABCD` are for purple chains.

## Aetherial Shackles

```
【Aetherial Shackles】
Swap within same coloured marker as needed.
```

In essence, we want the person with the purple chain as one of the four inner `ABCD` markers, and the person with the red chain as one of the outer `1234` markers.

If someone assigned to an inner marker is targeted with the red chain, that person swaps position with the same coloured marker (`A` with `1`, `B` with `2`, etc.) This then puts red on the outside.

The same logic applies if someone on the outer markers gets the purple chain.

## Intemperance

```
【Intemperance】
S tile not 3x Ice → MT+D3 swap for 3rd gems.
```

There are two possible gem configurations. One of them will require MT and D3 to swap positions for the third set.

The "no swap" configuration is identified by *either*

- Three blue gems on the southern tile.
- The top and bottom gems on the corner tiles share the same colour.

In this case, everyone can resolve their own assigned tile throughout the entire mechanic.

The "need to swap" configuration is identified by *either*

- A red gem in the southern tile.
- The top and bottom gems on the corner tiles are different colours.

In this case, MT and D3 will need to swap tiles for the **third** set of gemstones. 

## Fourfold Shackles

The idea is to have the four purple chains in the inner markers, and the four red chains on the outer markers.

The macro uses the duration of each chain's debuff to assign positions, although if you have voice comms, you can coordinate through that instead.

**Be careful as the outer marker positions may differ between parties.**
