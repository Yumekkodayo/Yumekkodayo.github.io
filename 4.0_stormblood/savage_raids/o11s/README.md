# Alphascape V3.0 (Savage)

This is the "Haru Yamagata" strategy you'll often see on PF, usually shortened to just "Haru strat" (ハル式 - "HARU shiki")

## Markers

Markers are used for Rocket Punch. `1` and `2` are for the first set (before the Level Checker), while `ABCD` are for the other Rocket Punches (after Level Checker).
