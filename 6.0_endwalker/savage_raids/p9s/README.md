# Anabaseios: The Ninth Circle (Savage)

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/532345) has gone with Nukemaru's strat for P9S.

{% include youtube.html id="URo06JSGEgM" %}

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check the Scrambled Succession ("Limit Cut 1") strat used.
  - **Japanese** parties will go with the strat that has [the party run around in a circle](#scrambled-succession-mario-kart) (known as 無職マラソン in Japanese).
  - **English** parties may do the ["Intercard" strat](#scrambled-succession-intercard) that resolves two of the Ice AoEs at one corner, before flipping the map around (known as ぶたばら式 in Japanese).

- Check the Chimeric Succession positions for players marked `1` and `2`.
  - Some macros have `1` go **west**, and `2` go **east**.
  - Some macros have `1` go **east**, and `2` go **west**.

## Nukemaru's strat (Mario Kart)

This is the preferred strat by JP that Nukemaru featured. It uses the "Mario Kart" strat for Scrambled Succession, known as 無職マラソン in Japanese.

### English (Mario Kart)

### Scrambled Succession (Mario Kart)

This is the strat chosen by Game8 that involves splitting the party into two groups- players with numbers, and players without numbers.

- Non-numbered players:
  - Start at the orb numbered 1.
  - Rotate to the next wall if you do not get a blue mark.
  - Rotate **backwards** when your Ice AoE resolves.
- Numbered players:
  - Start at the orb numbered 5 (directly opposite).
  - Rotate when AoEs resolve.

## Nukemaru's strat + Intercardinal Limit Cut

This is the preferred strat by EN. It takes Nukemaru's strat, but replaces Scrambled Succession (Limit Cut) with the Intercard strat, known as ぶたばら式 in Japanese.

### English (Intercard)

```
{% include_relative macros/p9s_intercard.en.txt %}
```

### Japanese (Intercard/ぶたばら式)

```
{% include_relative macros/p9s_intercard.jp.txt %}
```

### Scrambled Succession (Intercard)

This is the strat more favoured in EN that involves resolving the Ice/Fire twice before swapping sides. Of note, the player numbered 6 needs to pay special attention as they can potentially cause a party wipe if they are slow to move.

(N.B: This is also confusingly called the "JP strat", even though JP DCs no longer do this.)

- Start between the orbs numbered 5 and 7.
- First two iterations:
  - Ice goes between the orbs numbered 1 and 3.
  - Fire (players 2 and 4) goes between the orbs numbered 5 and 7.
- Last two iterations (swap sides):
  - Ice goes between the orbs numbered 5 and 7.
  - Fire (players 6 and 8) goes between the orbs numbered 1 and 3.
