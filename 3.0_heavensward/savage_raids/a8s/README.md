## Blue Mage Notes

### Required Spells
**All** party members should have the following skills equipped to pass Gavel:

- Frog Legs
- Mighty Guard
- Devour

### Other notes

Since BLU parties have comparatively higher DPS, changing the adds phase kill order will make things easier:

1. Kill Blaster
2. Kill Swindler
3. Trigger Brawler's 50%
4. Trigger Vortexer's 50%
5. Kill Brawler and Vortexer

Diamondback gets a lot of use this fight, but some notes:

- Diamondback will let you survive Enumeration (with a damage-down penalty).
- Diamondback **will not** let you survive Height Error.
- Diamondback **will not** let you survive Ultra Flash.
