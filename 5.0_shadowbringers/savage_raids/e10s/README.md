# Eden's Promise: Litany (Savage)

[Akito's strat (あきと式)](https://youtu.be/mLFIYKvt3QY)

### Things to check on Party Finder

Since tanks swap during this fight, check with your other tank whether MT for Umbral Orbs means whoever is currently tanking the boss, or the original MT.

## English
```
{% include_relative macros/e10s.en.txt %}
```

## Japanese
```
{% include_relative macros/e10s.jp.txt %}
```

## Markers

The markers are just for orientation. The intercardinal markers also are indicators for the range of the AoE when the boss stands up.

## Final Voidgates

PF uses Akito's strat: [video](https://youtu.be/mLFIYKvt3QY&t=743)

This is not mentioned in the macro, and you are expected to know this coming in.

(Yes, this is a melee downtime strategy.)
