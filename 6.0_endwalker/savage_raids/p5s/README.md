# Abyssos: The Fifth Circle (Savage)

## Markers

There aren't any real fixed set of markers used for this fight- this set places markers on the potential poison puddle positions:

- `ABCD` are used for orientation.
- `1234` are useful when calling out where to move during Ruby Glow 3.

This set of markers simply puts everything in a circle.

- `ABCD` are used for orientation.
- `1234` are useful when calling out where to move during Ruby Glow 3.

## Ruby Glow 5

The way Game 8 chose to resolve Ruby Glow 5 is to assign the MT group to the north-side **poison** quadrant, and the ST group to the south side **poison** quadrant.

Once you've identified your quadrant, move to the side **without** the poison crystal (this will always be next to the yellow crystal that will explode).

The four possible outcomes are as follows:

  <tr>

  </tr>

    <td><img src="images/ruby_5_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Ruby Glow 5]</b> Some groups refer to a N/W and S/E strat- how is that different?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This refers to a different method of assigning quadrants that some EN groups do. The main difference is what the party pays attention to.</p><p>Game8 unfortunately chose the strat that focuses on the <b>poison crystals</b>, which leads to a somewhat counterintuitive case 1/4 of the time.</p><p>This strat assigns the light parties based on the <b>yellow crystals</b> instead, which keeps to the "MT group N/W", "ST group S/E" convention.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that both methods work out to the same outcome in 3/4 of the cases, but not the last 1/4.</p></td></tr>
